# interactive_dictionary

A Wiktionary-powered ePub 3.0 that defines 60 new French verbs and proposes an interactive quiz at the end with three difficulty levels. The order of words takes compositionality into account, i.e. the order is from the least to the most guessable. Finally, the verbs in question must be derived from a noun exclusively.

The ePub is modeled with Multiple-State Objects and is thus InDesign-generated. Its content is extracted by XSLT 2.0 from the manually chunked 2020 Wiktionary dump downloadable here:

The name of the final product is "Verbs that everyone knows. Or almost." (Verbes que tout le monde conna√Æt. Ou presque.)
